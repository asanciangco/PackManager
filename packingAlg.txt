Weather report per day

Packing list is just that: a list mapping a "Packable" to a number (how many).
Packables should be able to change their name by user preference:
	-Ex: For a if user is male, say "short sleeve tshirt," if female, say "light top"

pseudocode!

create packing list:
	init packing list:
		each list should have tolietries
		if swimming:
			include swimwear as a function of days
		if fancy dinner:
			include formalwear as a function of days (~tbd, we have no way of knowing if multiple dinners)

	for day in days:
		increase number of tops
		increase number of bottoms
		increase number of underwear
		increase number of socks
		increase number of pairs of shoes
		increase number of hats / headware

	if laundry:
		cap number packables in each bucket

	round totals in some way to make them whole numbers
	return the packing list

#example incrementing function --> interface will hide details, strategy pattern to decide
increase number of tops (daily weather, packinglist):
	switch (average of daily high/low):
	case HOT:
		packinglist.light_top += 1;
		return;
	case WARM:
		packinglist.light_top += 0.75;
		packinglist.heavy_top += 0.25;
	case NORMAL:
		packinglist.light_top += 0.5;
		packinglist.heavy_top += 0.5;
	case COOL:
		packinglist.light_top += 0.25;
		packinglist.heavy_top += 0.75;
	case COLD:
		packinglist.heavy_top += 1;
